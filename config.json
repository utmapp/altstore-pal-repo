          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\n* (macOS) **UTM Remote server for macOS** On macOS 13+, you can enable UTM Server from the new option on the home screen or from Window -> UTM Server. Once enabled, you can stream QEMU backend VMs to supported clients. The preferences page includes additional options including auto-starting the server and allowing external connections so it can be used outside of the local network. New documentation pages will be added in the future.\n* (macOS) **UTM Remote client for iOS and visionOS** When UTM Server is enabled on macOS, you can connect to it with the new UTM Remote client which uses the same frontend as UTM for iOS/visionOS but without any of the QEMU backend. You can get it for free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-remote-virtual-machines/id6470773592).\n* (iOS) UTM SE's wizard now allow you to create a VM easily with a floppy boot image.\n* (iOS SE) We now accept donations through In-App Purchase. If you would like to support us, please use the heart button on top of the list of VMs.\n\n## Notes\n* (macOS) The automation URI scheme has been removed due to potential security issues if the user clicks a malicious link that sends an input to the VM.

This should address file system corruption issues. (thanks @gnattu)\n* (macOS 12+) AVF: Use full synchronization mode for all non-external drives. This should address file system corruption issues. (thanks @gnattu)\n\n## Changes (v4.5.2)\n* Improved icon selector UI (thanks @js-john)\n* Changed the position of destructive buttons in various confirmation alerts to better comply with Apple Human Interface Guidelines\n* Wizard: New options for \"Other\" operating system to allow for Floppy boot as well as legacy hardware (useful for setting up a DOS machine)\n* Wizard: Fixed an issue where the Windows Guest Tools will be downloaded even when a non-Windows VM is created\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Simplified + Hong Kong) (thanks @changanmoon)\n* Localization: Updated Polish (thanks @mavethee)\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where a machine with an empty removable drive cannot be booted\n* (iOS) New view for donation options\n* (visionOS) Fixed a crash when any VM is selected\n* (macOS) New setting: \"Capture input automatically when window is focused\" when enabled will automatically capture mouse/keyboard when a QEMU VM is started and when the VM window is clicked on (thanks @js-john)\n* (macOS) When \"Capture input automatically when entering full screen\" is enabled and the cursor moves to a different workspace (for example through a gesture), the cursor will be captured again upon re-entering the QEMU VM (#6242) (thanks @haroldm)\n* (macOS) Server: Fixed a crash due to bad format string\n* (macOS) Home: Support drag & drop onto a removable drive or shared directory (#3312) (thanks @hamtiko)\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where cloning/moving an AVFW VM is extremely slower than Finder (#6262)\n* (macOS) Added a progress indicator for long duration tasks such as cloning/moving a VM or reclaiming free space (#4006)\n\n## Changes (v4.5.1)\n* Fixed an issue with file locking resulting in VMs refusing to boot (#5757, #5830)\n* Fixed incorrect VM size calculation (#6166)\n* Show confirmation popup for VM downloads (#6156)\n* Removed automation URI scheme due to potential security issues (#6155)\n* Fixed display of newly selected custom icon (#6137)\n* Wizard: allow completely deleting RAM and storage size (#5885)\n* Scripting: Fixed file and process commands not working due to incorrect object life cycle (#5963)\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\n* Localization: Updated Polish (thanks @mavethee)\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Simplified + Traditional) (thanks @changanmoon)\n* (iOS) Fixed zooming with pinch (#6179)\n* (macOS) Fixed USB icon always disabled (#6222)\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when removing a device while a text field is highlighted (#5901)\n* (macOS) Fixed error message when double-clicking on a headless VM which has already been started (#5972)\n* (macOS) AVF: New display option to disable dynamic resolution in macOS 14+ VMs (#5873)\n* (macOS) Remove \"VM display size is fixed\" global setting because it was confusing and does not do the right thing\n* (macOS) Fixed incorrect display scaling when host screen resolution is smaller than VM display size (#6214)\n\n## Changes (v4.5.0)\n* Updated ANGLE to latest Safari version\n* Fixed a crash due to screenshot being saved while the image was being destroyed (#4009)\n* Fixed a memory leak caused by a retain cycle while observing changes in the VM state\n* Localization: Added Italian (thanks @garamb1)\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\n* Localization: Updated Polish (thanks @mavethee)\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Simplified + Traditional) (thanks @changanmoon)\n* (macOS) Add UTM Server feature\n* (iOS) Fixed the icon name for UTM SE erroneously set to UTM in translation (#5968)\n* (iOS) Disable logging of keyboard keys when Debug Logs are enabled.
